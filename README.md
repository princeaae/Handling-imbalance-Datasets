## 🌟 Introduction
Imbalanced datasets are common in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare event prediction. These datasets often lead to biased machine learning models that favor the majority class. This project demonstrates techniques to effectively handle such datasets, ensuring robust and fair predictions.

## ⚙️ Techniques Used
1. **Up Sampling**:
    - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
    - Random Oversampling
2. **Down Sampling**:
    - Random Undersampling
3. **Algorithmic Adjustments**:
    - Cost-sensitive learning
    - Balanced random forests
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Precision-Recall AUC
    - F1-score
    - Matthews Correlation Coefficient
